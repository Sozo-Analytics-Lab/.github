# Sozo Analytics Lab

> We are at a transition point in computing. We are moving from tools that calculate to partners that understand.

At Sozo Analytics Lab, we are building the infrastructure for this transition. We believe that intelligence without context is a novelty, and agency without memory is a toy. We build systems that are coherent, persistent, and grounded in physical reality.

## The Perception Stack

We view the intelligence we build not as a collection of features, but as an integrated system.

### [SozoGraph](https://github.com/Sozo-Analytics-Lab/sozograph) — The Soul
Most agents have the memory of a goldfish. They retrieve text; they do not maintain belief. SozoGraph is our memory architecture — a *Cognitive Passport* that distills history into structured state. It ensures that an agent's understanding of you is consistent, private, and portable.

### [Sozo Athena](https://sozo-athena-186891137448.us-west1.run.app) — The Brain
A system designed to deconstruct the world. Athena doesn't just identify objects; she synthesizes them. From a visual capture, she generates the scientific context, the engineering blueprint, and the interactive simulation required to truly understand how a thing works.

### [SozoFix](https://sozofix.tech) — The Physical Hand
The circular economy is not a marketing concept; it is an engineering challenge. SozoFix bridges the gap between a broken item and a functional one. We combine spatial vision with step-by-step guidance to ensure that "repair" is as intuitive as "replace."

### [Sozo Lattice](https://github.com/Sozo-Analytics-Lab/Sozo-Lattice) — The Material Foundation
We are applying the same rigour we use for software to the physical world. By modeling material failure at the atomic level, we enable sustainable design that is as durable as it is responsible.

### [Sozo Pitch Helper](https://pitchhelper.netlify.app) — The Behavioral Mirror
High-stakes communication requires more than practice — it requires data. We provide the feedback loop for human performance, measuring clarity, understanding, and composure to help individuals master the art of the pitch.

## Engineering Philosophy

We do not believe in "good enough."

Our work is defined by a deep respect for the integration of services. We don't just use APIs; we orchestrate them. We don't just train models; we bring them to life.

**Deterministic Reliability**
We treat AI output as untrusted code, wrapping it in validation loops to ensure the final product is always stable.

**The Economics of Intelligence**
We obsess over efficiency. We've demonstrated that intelligent resource allocation — like our *8-Spark Economy* — yields a better user experience at a fraction of the cost.

**The Long-Now**
We are moving away from ephemeral sessions to lifelong relationships. We build for the years, not the minutes.

## The Work

We are a lab of engineers and designers focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical utility. We are not just building tools; we are engineering the future of human capability.
